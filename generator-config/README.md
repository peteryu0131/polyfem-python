# PolyFEM generator configuration

The API generator reads two files in this directory:

- `api_aliases.json` defines public factory names and aliases.
- `id_relationships.json` connects geometry IDs to materials, boundary conditions and contact settings.

The generic generator lives in the `python-from-jse/` submodule.

## Generated global configuration helpers

The generic generator accepts keyword arguments directly on polymorphic
factories, for example `polyfem.time(dt=0.01, tend=0.5, integrator="BDF")`.
It selects a schema branch using its required fields; explicit variant objects
remain supported for compatibility.

Root configuration sections also generate methods on the model builder:

```python
import polyfem

model = polyfem.model()
model.time(dt=0.01, tend=0.5, integrator="BDF")
model.units(length="cm", mass="g", time="s")
model.output(directory="runs/example")
config = model.config()
```

These setters return the model and replace the same section when called again.
Passing that section again to `model.config(...)` raises an error instead of
silently overriding it. Existing builder methods (including `space()` and
body/selection helpers) retain their existing behavior; they are not replaced
by generated setters.

Maintain this behavior in `python-from-jse/generator/JsonToTreeClass.py` and
`python-from-jse/generator/model_builder.py`, not the generated output. From the
repository root, regenerate with:

```powershell
conda run -n polyfem python tools/generate_polyfem_api.py
```
